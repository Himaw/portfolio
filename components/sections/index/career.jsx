                <p>
                  During my internship as a full-stack software engineer, I
                  contributed in developing and maintaining web applications,
                  balancing front-end and back-end development. My role involved
                  creating user-friendly interfaces, ensuring responsive
                  layouts, and optimizing user experiences. I also worked on
                  managing databases, APIs, and server infrastructure.
                  Collaborating with a talented team, I contributed to project
                  success by writing efficient code, troubleshooting issues, and
                  enhancing application performance. This experience
                  strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my passion
                  for innovative, user-centric software solutions.
